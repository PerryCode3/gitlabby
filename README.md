# 🧠 gitlabby  
*A cozy CI/CD playground built for learning, testing, and leveling up DevOps workflows.*

---

## 🚀 Overview  
**gitlabby** is a local GitLab + Docker + SonarQube sandbox designed for hands-on DevOps practice.  
It’s where pipelines, scanners, and containers all come to hang out.

This project demonstrates:
- GitLab CI/CD automation
- Docker-based GitLab Runner
- Static code analysis with SonarQube
- Quality Gate enforcement for clean, secure builds

## 🧩 Pipeline Stages
| Stage | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| 🧱 **Build** | Prepare or compile source code (or container images). |
| 🧪 **Test** | Run validation or unit tests before deployment. |
| 🔍 **Analyze** | Scan code quality and security with SonarQube. |
| 🚢 **Deploy** | (Coming soon!) Deploy to containerized or cloud environments. |
